/*
 * DEPRECATED: This file has been refactored into a modular TypeScript structure.
 * 
 * The new implementation can be found in the src/ directory with the following structure:
 * - src/components/App.tsx - Main application component
 * - src/components/UI.tsx - Reusable UI components
 * - src/hooks/useStoryGame.ts - Business logic and state management
 * - src/types/index.ts - TypeScript type definitions
 * - src/utils/index.ts - Utility functions and API calls
 * - src/constants/index.ts - Application constants
 * 
 * This refactoring implements modern React and TypeScript best practices:
 * ✓ Type safety with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
 * ✓ Separation of concerns with modular architecture
 * ✓ Reusable components with proper prop interfaces
 * ✓ Custom hooks for business logic isolation
 * ✓ Error handling and input validation
 * ✓ Accessibility improvements with ARIA labels
 * ✓ ESLint configuration for code quality
 * ✓ Jest testing framework with sample tests
 * ✓ Comprehensive documentation
 * 
 * To use the new implementation:
 * 1. Run: npm install
 * 2. Build: npm run build
 * 3. Import: import App from './src'
 * 
 * For development:
 * - npm run dev (TypeScript watch mode)
 * - npm run lint (code quality check)
 * - npm run test (run tests)
 */

// Legacy import for backward compatibility (if needed)
// export { default } from './src/components/App';
